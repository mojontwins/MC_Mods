I like structures in Minecraft, and I've managed to create several big, interesting ones in Infhell or Inslands. Some of them feature in Infdev+ too. Now that I'm into some ModLoader coding spree, I've found that it is very lacking when it comes to let you add complex structures, lacking the necessary hooks. That's why I've created a simple ML/MLMP mod that hijacks on the chunk generators to provide such hooks.

While I was doing that, I was watching some YT videos by Dialko and I've heard him say that he wouldn't mind mineshafts in beta, so what would be better to test my **Better Structure API** mod than use it to generate vanilla mineshafts?

**Enhanced Beta Structures** will add mineshafts and, if you re lucky, surface strongholds. Just add **Better Structure API** and **Enhanced Beta Structures** to your ML/MLMP enabled client or server, and you are set.

Grab them in the [Modloader section](https://mojontwins.github.io/MC_Mods/modloader/#better-structure-api-for-b173).
