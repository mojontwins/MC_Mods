![Derp]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/derp.png)

Hello. This is a simple site I'm putting together to have all my Golden Age MC related mods together. I'm currently trying to fetch all my stuff and package it nicely, so bear with me. I'll post news here, but the beef can be accessed from the links in the header. If you are looking for [Infhell]({{site.baseurl}}/infhell2) or [Inslands]({{site.baseurl}}/inslands), for instance, they are in [Full Conversions]({{site.baseurl}}/fullconversion).

This is also me learning Jekyll and how it works alongside github pages.
