![The Aether for b1.6.6]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2026-02-04_08.17.10.png)

In the bin archive uploaded by Kodaichi to Archive.org, besides the very early b1.2_02 version, there's this build for b1.6.6. It was in a minecraft.jar that also contained NEI. I've repackaged this but I've left that in the zip, plus Modloader and a bunch of base class edits, so this will work standalone if you drop in b1.6.6 minecraft.jar or add it as a jar mod to b1.6.6 using MultiMC, Prism or the like.

Using NEI you can give yourself glowstone and a bucket of water and make the portal.

I've uploaded the mod and a MultiMC instance. The mod includes everything that's needed and has to be used as a jarmod to b1.6.6 (if you are using betacraft, for instance).

* [Get the mod]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/mod_aether_b1.6.6.zip).
* [Get the MultiMC instance]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/mod_aether_b1.6.6__MultiMC-instance.zip).
