<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>This is a list of my mods for Classic Minecraft. Most of them are full conversion jarmods or alternate reality bliss. You should be able to JAR-patch the old way or use modern solutions such as MultiMC and co., but you can always do it manually and use betacraft. Infhell and the latest version of Inslands are readily available from this launcher, tho'.</p>
