Here you will find some of my older mods and / or experiments. Most of them are abandoned right now, but I might resome or fix stuff if somebody is interested.

# Post Alpha

# Indev Modloader

# MP 125

# Retro Terrain Generator

Retro/Beta Terrain Generator add older terrain generators and/or removes sprinting / hunger (in some versions) to early release. It's a jarmod but it's designed to work alongside modloader / forge / shockahpi / etc. For example, RTG for r1.2.5 works with the Aether mod and all its dependences. You only have to add it as the last jarmod, after modloader, forge, shockahpi or player api.
